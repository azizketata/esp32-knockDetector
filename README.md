# ESP32-Knock-Sensor
## Demo

## Description
Knock pattern detection offers an intuitive and interactive way to control devices or authenticate users. This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller connected to a piezoelectric sensor to detect specific knock sequences. Users can program custom knock patterns, which can trigger actions like unlocking a door or activating devices.  

The detected knock sequences are sent via MQTT to a broker (Mosquitto). An aggregator, written in Python using the Paho MQTT client and Flask, collects this data and exposes it through a RESTful API. This allows for seamless integration with other systems and applications that can consume the knock data and validation results.  

## Features
* Customizable Knock Patterns: Program your own unique knock sequences for personalized interaction.  
* Real-time Data Transmission: Sends knock data and validation results over MQTT for immediate processing.  
* RESTful API Access: Aggregated data is accessible via a REST API for integration with other applications.  
* Visual Feedback: LEDs provide on-site visual indicators of system status and knock detection.  
* Multiple Sensor Support: Deploy multiple knock sensors within the network, each with unique IDs.  
* Wi-Fi Connectivity: ESP32 connects to a Wi-Fi network for wireless communication.  

## Technical Section
### Bill of Materials
* ESP32 Development Board (e.g., AZDelivery ESP32 Dev Kit V4)  
* Piezoelectric Sensor  
* 1M立 Resistor (pulldown resistor for the piezo sensor)  
* Push-button or Switch (for entering programming mode)  
* Red LED  
* Green LED  
* Resistors (e.g., 220立) for current limiting with LEDs  
* Breadboard and Jumper Wires  
* USB Cable (for programming the ESP32)  
* Computer (with PlatformIO or Arduino IDE)  
* Wi-Fi Network  
## Hardware Setup & Wiring (fritzing sketch coming soon) 
### Piezo Sensor Setup
* Connect one lead of the piezo sensor to GPIO36 (ADC1_CH0) on the ESP32.
* Connect the other lead to GND.
* Place a 1M立 pulldown resistor between GPIO36 and GND to stabilize the sensor readings.
### Programming Mode Switch
* Connect one terminal of the push-button or switch to GPIO21.
* Connect the other terminal to GND.
* The switch uses the internal pull-up resistor, so when pressed (LOW), it enters programming mode.
### LED Indicators
#### Red LED:
* Connect the anode (longer leg) to GPIO16 via a current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220立).
* Connect the cathode (shorter leg) to GND.
#### Green LED:
* Connect the anode to GPIO17 via a current-limiting resistor.
* Connect the cathode to GND.
## Software Setup - Sensor
### Prerequisites
PlatformIO installed in Visual Studio Code, or Arduino IDE with ESP32 support.
ESP32 Board Definitions installed in your development environment.
### Dependencies
* PubSubClient library (for MQTT communication)
* ArduinoJson library (for JSON serialization)
### Configuration
1.Open the knock.cpp file in your development environment.  
2.Update the Wi-Fi credentials:  
```cpp
const char* ssid = "Your_SSID";
const char* password = "Your_Password";
```
3.Set the MQTT broker IP address and port:
```cpp
IPAddress mqttBroker(192, 168, 0, 118); // Replace with your broker's IP
const int mqttPort = 1900;
```
4.Optionally, set a unique sensor ID:
```cpp
const char* sensorID = "knock_sensor_1";
```
### Compiling and Uploading
* Connect the ESP32 board to your computer via USB.
* Build and upload the code to the ESP32 using PlatformIO or the Arduino IDE.

## Software Setup - Aggregator
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x installed on your system.  
* Pip package manager.  
### Dependencies
* Install the required Python packages using the provided requirements.txt:

```cpp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs:  
paho-mqtt==1.6.1  
Flask==2.3.3  
jsonpickle==3.0.2  
### Configuration
1- Open the aggregator.py script located in the aggregator directory.
2- Update the MQTT broker IP address and port:

```python
mqttBroker = "192.168.0.103"  # Replace with your broker's IP address
mqttPort = 1900
```
### Running the Aggregator
Use the provided startupAggregator.sh script to run the aggregator:  

```bash
./startupAggregator.sh
```
* This script starts the Flask application on port 5050, accessible from any host (0.0.0.0).
### Deploy the ESP32 Sensor
1.Power on the ESP32.
It will connect to the Wi-Fi network and start detecting knock patterns.
### Interact with the Sensor
Use the programming switch to enter programming mode and set a custom knock pattern.
Knock on the sensor to test detection and pattern validation.
## Employed Technologies
* ESP32 Microcontroller: Provides Wi-Fi connectivity and processing power for sensor data acquisition.  
* Piezoelectric Sensor: Detects vibrations from knocks, converting mechanical stress into electrical signals.  
* MQTT Protocol: Lightweight messaging protocol ideal for IoT applications.  
* Python with Flask and Paho MQTT: Aggregator uses Flask for the REST API and Paho MQTT client to subscribe to MQTT topics.  
* Arduino Framework: Used to program the ESP32 with familiar functions and libraries.  
* Wi-Fi Communication: Allows the sensor to communicate over the network wirelessly.  
* JSON Serialization: Data is serialized into JSON format for easy parsing and integration.  
## Endpoints
* The aggregator exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:

* GET /knocks
* Description: Retrieves data of all knock sequences from all sensors.

* Response: JSON object containing knock data indexed by sensor IDs.  
 Example Response:

```json
{
  "knock_sensor_1": {
    "sensor_id": "knock_sensor_1",
    "timestamp": 1625097600000,
    "knock_sequence": [50, 25, 25, 50, 100, 50],
    "validation": "success"
  },
  "knock_sensor_2": {
    "sensor_id": "knock_sensor_2",
    "timestamp": 1625097660000,
    "knock_sequence": [75, 50, 50, 75],
    "validation": "failure"
  }
}
```
[Additional endpoints can be added as needed.]

## Usage ( new addition coming soon)
### Programming a New Knock Pattern
1.Enter Programming Mode: Press and hold the programming switch connected to GPIO21.  
2.Visual Indicator: The red LED will turn on, indicating programming mode.  
3.Record Knock Pattern: Knock the desired pattern on the sensor.  
4.Exit Programming Mode: Release the programming switch.  
5.Confirmation: LEDs will blink alternately to confirm the new pattern is stored.  
### Validating a Knock Pattern
1.Ensure Normal Mode: Make sure the programming switch is not pressed.  
2.Perform Knock Pattern: Knock the stored pattern on the sensor.  
3.Feedback:  
    Success: Green LED blinks; validation result is sent over MQTT.  
    Failure: Red LED blinks; validation failure is sent over MQTT.  
4.Trigger Actions: Upon successful validation, actions like unlocking a door can be triggered.  
## Testing
A test publisher script test_publisher.py is provided to simulate sensor data being sent to the MQTT broker. This can be used to test the aggregator and REST API without the physical hardware.
